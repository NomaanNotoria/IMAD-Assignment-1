## Application Overview

Social Spark is an Android app built to help you keep in touch with people who matter, even on days when you’re busy. Tailored for Cora and anyone looking to simplify social interactions, Social Spark gives you short, personalized ideas (“social sparks”) based on the time of day—so it’s always easy to reach out.

### Why Social Spark?

Let’s face it—life gets hectic. It’s way too easy to lose touch. Social Spark makes connecting simple:
- You get time-based suggestions so you always know how to reach out.
- No more overthinking. The app gives you clear, concrete actions.
- It helps you check in with friends and family, even when you’re swamped.
- And with its playful design, connecting feels less like a chore and more like fun.

Key Code Snippets
Input Processing Logic
private fun getSocialSpark() {
    val userInput = timeInput.text.toString().trim()
    val inputLower = userInput.lowercase()
    
    val suggestion = when {
        inputLower.contains("morning") && !inputLower.contains("mid") -> {
            Log.i(TAG, "Morning time detected")
            "☀️ Morning Spark: Send a 'Good morning' text to a family member"
        }
        inputLower.contains("mid-morning") -> {
            Log.i(TAG, "Mid-morning detected")
            "💼 Mid-Morning Spark: Reach out to a colleague with a quick 'Thank you'"
        }
        // Additional time categories...
        else -> {
            showErrorMessage("Please enter a valid time")
            return
        }
    }
    suggestionTextView.text = suggestion
}
